| Simple and intuitive demonstration of interaction with Bandada's off-chain groups. |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

This example script uses the [Bandada API SDK](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/bandada/tree/main/libs/api-sdk) to interact with a pre-existing off-chain group.

In one-click you will be able to print group information, add or remove members, and create a merkle inclusion proof. This proof is a zero-knowledge proof that verifies a user's membership in the group without revealing their identity.

To learn more about Bandada, please visit the [repository](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/bandada) and [documentation](https://pse-team.notion.site/Bandada-82d0d9d3c6b64b7bb2a09d4c7647c083?pvs=4).

## üõ† Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vplasencia/bandada-sdk-demo.git
```

and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd bandada-sdk-demo && yarn
```

## üîß Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You must have created a Bandada off-chain group through the [Bandada Dashboard](https://bandada.pse.dev) in order to correctly populate the environment variables (see the GIF below).

```bash
# The unique identifier of the Group.
GROUP_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
# The API Key of the Group.
GROUP_API_KEY="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
# A valid invite code to join the Group.
MEMBER_INVITE_CODE="XXXXXXXX"
```

### Code quality and formatting

Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to analyze the code and catch bugs:

```bash
yarn lint
```

Run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to check formatting rules:

```bash
yarn prettier
```

Or to automatically format the code:

```bash
yarn prettier:write
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

After successfully running the script for the first time, if you try to run it again, you will receive the error message `400 - Bad Request - Invite code 'XXXXXX' has already been redeemed``. To resolve this issue, you just need to generate a new invite code. That's it ‚ú®
